    "> CreditScore—can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Geography—a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Gender—it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Age—this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tenure—refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Balance—also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "> HasCrCard—denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "> IsActiveMember—active customers are less likely to leave the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "> EstimatedSalary—as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.\n",
